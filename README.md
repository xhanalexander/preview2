# tilt-type

A Google variable font - Recursive - is manipulated with mobile phone tilt and compass. There's a bit of code to ask for access on iOS.

p5js used to access mobile phone tilt and compass values. 
p5 isn't really needed here, but its useful and a great tool for sharing/educating. See the sketch here: https://editor.p5js.org/amcc/sketches/dNOLfLgub and a simpler version here: https://editor.p5js.org/amcc/sketches/mWj6e9Dmd
